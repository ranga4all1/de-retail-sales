## Dev Setup

This project is entirely developed in cloud using GitHub Codespaces. A free version of GitHub Codespaces should suffice for this project.

## Steps

1. Build GCP infra using terraform. If not, install terraform using this [link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
    - Check that terraform is installed  
    ```
    terraform --version
    ```
    - Update `variables.tf` file with your variables
    - Update `.tf` files to terraform format 
    ```
    cd terraform-gcp
    terraform fmt
    ```

    - Download providers
    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    - See the plan
     ```
     terraform plan
     ```

    - apply the plan to create infra
    ```
    terraform apply
    yes
    ```
    - Verify in google cloud console that bucket and bigquerry dataset are created 
    - Destroy the infra (optional, at the end of the project to cleanup)
    ```
    terraform destroy
    yes
    ```
